# EDUCLOUD
EduCloud is a cloud-based platform that aims to assist students and educators learning with modern tools that allow them to upload, access, and manage learning materials.

## WHY EDUCLOUD?
EduCloud was created as an initiative to enhance the quality of learning through technology and innovation.
Originally inspired by the needs of my university, this platform aims to provide students and educators with secure, accessible,
and modern tools for sharing and managing learning materials.
My goal is to contribute to a future where quality education is not limited by location or resources, but empowered by innovation.
